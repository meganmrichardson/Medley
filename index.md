## Welcome to Medley

Medley is a fruitful take on a programming language, with strengths in both enjoyability and ease of use. Medley employs a more natural language approach to programming, all while having a unique theme that makes it both easy and fun to use. The target is for either younger or newer beginning programmers, where a lot of the more complex concepts of programming is simplified by making it similar to English.

To learn more about Medley and explore the different aspects of the language visit [Medley's Github Repository](https://github.com/meganmrichardson/Medley). We hope you enjoy!
